   Helper classes for sparse faceting. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-5894">SOLR-5894</a> for
   initial JIRA issue.

<h2>Sparse facet counting principle</h2>
<p>
   Field Cache faceting with Strings and sort=count uses a counter for each unique field value. The counters are filled
   based on the result set and the X values with the highest counts are located. With non-sparse operation all the
   counters are iterated sequentially. With sparse operation, only the updated counters are iterated in a random
   access manner. This is possible due to special purpose counter structures,
   see {@link org.apache.solr.request.sparse.SparseCounterPacked} and
   {@link org.apache.solr.request.sparse.SparseCounterInt} for the concrete implementations.
</p><p>
   The sparse counters holds a counter for each unique facet value together with a smaller pointer list. The pointers
   are indexes in the counter list. When a counter is increased for the first time, its index is added to the pointer
   list. When it is time to iterate the updated counters, only the counters referenced in the pointer list are visited.
   After usage, the counters are cleaned by setting the updated counters to 0 and the length of the pointer list to 0.
</p><p>
   If the number of updated counters exceed the pointer list size, the whole counter structure is marked as non-sparse
   and iteration will be done over all counters. The time spend maintaining the pointer structure up to that point is
   the wasted, so sparse faceting attempts to guess if this will happen. Under the na?ve assumption that references
   from documents to field values are of uniform distribution, the formula <code>hitcount/maxdoc*total_references</code>
   is used to calculate the expected number of updated counters. If this exceeds the number of allocated pointers,
   the counter structure is marked as non-sparse from the beginning.
   See <a href="http://sbdevel.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/sparse-facet-counting-without-the-downsides/">Sparse
   facet counting without the downsides</a> for details.

<h2>Counter caching</h2>
<p>
   A cache is used to hold sparse counter structures, to avoid the performance overhead of allocating large structures
   from the heap. Measurements shows that it is markedly faster to clear large arrays than it is to free them and
   allocate new ones. The cache holds a mix of empty counter structures and filled structures, from the first phase of
   distributed faceting. A background thread handles clearing of counters. This lowers response time for the client.
   See {@link org.apache.solr.request.sparse.SparseCounterPoolController} and
   {@link org.apache.solr.request.sparse.SparseCounterPool} for the concrete implementation.
